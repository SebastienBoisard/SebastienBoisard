Hi, I'm Seb. :wave:  
I'm a senior computer scientist, back-end developer at [Ausha](https://www.ausha.co/).

  - I love Go :heart:  
  - but I can also code in Python :wink: 
  - I'm passionate about distributed systems (microservice and/or event-drive architecture, scalabilty, security, monitoring, control and documentation)
