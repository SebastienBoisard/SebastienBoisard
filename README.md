Hi, I'm Seb. :wave:  
I'm a senior developer, tech leader at [GFPTech](https://www.gfpfrance.com/). 

I'm actually looking for a new job with technical challenges.  
My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-boisard/

:arrow_forward: One of my technical interview project in PHP => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/library_technical_test  
:arrow_forward: A small project in Golang to play with MongoDB and JsonRPC => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/tamago  


Although I have some knowledge in front-end (with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)), I prefer to work on back-end projects.  

By the way, my current bedside book is ['Building Microservices'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/) from Sam Newman
