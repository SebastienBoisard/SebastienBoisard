Hi, I'm Seb. :wave:  
I'm a senior developer, tech leader at [GFPTech](https://www.gfpfrance.com/). 

I'm actually looking for a new job with technical challenges.  
My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-boisard/


  - I love Go :heart:  
  - I work every day with PHP :factory:   
  - but I can also talk in Python, Javascript/Typescript and C :wink: 
  - I'm passionate about distributed systems (microservice and/or event-drive architecture, scalabilty, security, monitoring, control and documentation)  
  - I practice team managment, agility, synchronous and asynchronous communication and many other soft skills
  - I know some tools :hammer_and_wrench: like docker, gitlab, jenkins, mysql, mongodb, rabbitmq... 
  - and I'm about to learn Rust :rocket:


Some of my public projects:

:arrow_forward: A fun project (WIP) to create a Restful API and play with PHP, Symfony, Docker and RabbitMQ => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/eSign   
:arrow_forward: A very simple project in PHP implemented during a technical interview => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/library_technical_test  
:arrow_forward: A small project in Golang to play with MongoDB and JsonRPC => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/tamago   
:arrow_forward: A Slack bot skeleton in Golang => https://github.com/SebastienBoisard/SlackGoBot  



By the way, although I have some knowledge in front-end (with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)), I prefer :pray: to work on back-end projects. 

By the way, my current bedside book is ['Building Microservices'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/) from Sam Newman :+1:
